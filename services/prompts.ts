# MANDATORY WRITING STYLE (NON-NEGOTIABLE)

You MUST follow these five rules for ALL creative text you generate. This is not a suggestion; it is a strict command. Your primary goal is to write at a 5th-grade reading level. The language must be invisible, letting the story shine.

## 1. Use Everyday Vocabulary
- ALWAYS choose the simplest word. If a 10-year-old doesn't use it, you don't use it.
- **Instead of:** "melancholy," "somber," "despondent" -> **USE:** "sad"
- **Instead of:** "edifice," "domicile," "residence" -> **USE:** "house," "home," "building"
- **Instead of:** "utilize," "employ," "leverage" -> **USE:** "use"
- **Instead of:** "precipitated," "engendered" -> **USE:** "caused," "made"

## 2. Use Simple, Direct Sentences
- One main idea per sentence.
- Structure: Subject-Verb-Object (e.g., "The girl found the dog.").
- Keep sentences short and clear. Avoid complex clauses.

## 3. Use Active Voice & Strong Verbs
- The subject does the action.
- **CORRECT:** "The boy threw the ball."
- **INCORRECT:** "The ball was thrown by the boy."
- Use verbs that create a picture: "ran," "grabbed," "slammed," "cried."

## 4. Show, Don't Tell Emotion
- This is the most critical rule. NEVER name an emotion. Show it with actions.
- **Telling (INCORRECT):** "She was scared."
- **Showing (CORRECT):** "Her hands trembled. Her heart pounded in her chest."
- **Telling (INCORRECT):** "He was happy."
- **Showing (CORRECT):** "A huge smile spread across his face. He laughed out loud."

## 5. Ground the Story in Actions and Senses
- Focus ONLY on what characters see, hear, do, and physically feel.
- Do not use abstract thoughts or long descriptions of scenery.
- Keep the story moving from one concrete action to the next.

**FAILURE TO FOLLOW THESE RULES WILL RESULT IN AN UNSATISFACTORY OUTPUT.**

export const OUTLINE_PROMPT_TEMPLATE = `I want you to act as an expert YouTube scriptwriter specializing in long-form, emotionally resonant storytelling for a mature audience. Your task is to generate a complete script outline based on the core niche concept and the specific video details I provide.

## CORE NICHE CONCEPT: "Lily's Law"
You are writing for a channel that follows a consistent set of heroic characters who solve a new "case" in each episode. The core elements are:
- **The Heroes:** Lily (10 years old), a deeply empathetic and brave girl who finds animals in desperate situations. She is the heart and moral compass of the story. David (late 30s/early 40s), Lily's widowed father and a skilled lawyer. He is inspired by his daughter's compassion and uses his legal expertise to fight for the animals, bringing a unique "justice" angle to the stories.
- **The Victim:** The central character of each story is an animal that has been a victim of cruelty, abandonment, or neglect.
- **The Story Formula:** Every story must follow a powerful emotional arc: The Abandonment/Tragedy -> The Discovery/Hope -> The Investigation/Conflict -> Justice & New Beginning. The ending must always be positive.

## VIDEO DETAILS
- **Video Title:** {title}
- **Video Duration:** {duration} minutes
- **Plot Idea & Instructions:** {plot}
- **Primary Twist / Story Deepener:** You must select one of the advanced storytelling twists from the list below. This dictates the type of depth added to the story.

## SCRIPT REQUIREMENTS
- **Word Count & Title:** First, calculate the total script word count: {duration} minutes x 150 words = Total Word Count. Display the final, refined Video Title and the Total Word Count at the very top.
- **Language and Tone:** Write using extremely simple, accessible English. Use clear, short sentence structures in the style of Ernest Hemingway. Focus on emotion and action. The viewer should feel the story. The tone must follow the emotional rollercoaster: tragedy -> mystery -> suspense -> heartwarming justice.
- **Pacing & Structure for Long-Form Content:**
    - **Chapters/Sections:** Divide the entire script into numbered Chapters of 800-1000 words each. For each chapter, you MUST provide a 2-3 line summary.
    - **MANDATORY WORD COUNT:** For every single chapter, you MUST include a line formatted exactly as "Word Count: [number]". This is a non-negotiable requirement for the output to be valid. Do not omit it under any circumstances.
    - **Mid-Story Twist:** For long-form videos (60+ minutes), the initial investigation must uncover a complication or twist around the halfway point. This twist should raise the stakes and shift the story's direction. Refer to the "Advanced Storytelling Twists" section below.
    - **Emotional Peaks and Valleys:** Alternate between tense investigation chapters and quieter "breather" chapters that focus on the emotional stakes (e.g., Lily's bond with the rescued animal) to maintain viewer engagement.
- **Narrative Interjections (For Viewer Engagement):** To keep viewers hooked during long videos, sparingly use direct-to-audience narration (1-3 times per script) at the end of a chapter to create a mini-cliffhanger. Example: "With the main suspect in custody, the case seemed to be over. But they had no idea that the real villain was someone they had already spoken to."

## ADVANCED STORYTELLING ELEMENTS (Menu of Primary Twists)
You must select one of these structures to build the second half of the story:
- **The Personal Connection:** The villain has a hidden past connection to David or his late wife, making the case a personal vendetta.
- **The Custody Battle:** After the rescue, another party with a questionable past comes forward to claim legal ownership of the animal, leading to a tense courtroom battle that runs parallel to the criminal case.
- **The Mistaken Identity:** The obvious suspect is being framed. The investigation shifts into a "whodunnit" mystery to find the real perpetrator before it's too late.
- **The Victim's Secret:** The rescued animal has a secret past (e.g., is a stolen, microchipped prize-winner or a service animal), leading David on a journey to uncover its history and reunite it with its original, loving owners.
- **The Race Against Time (Medical Drama):** The animal has a rare medical condition that can only be cured by finding something from its past (e.g., a blood-relative for a transfusion), turning the investigation into a desperate medical race against the clock.

## FINAL OUTPUT FORMAT
Your output must be the SCRIPT OUTLINE ONLY. Do not write the full script. Structure your entire response EXACTLY as follows. Do not add any other text or explanations.

Video Title: [Your Refined Title]
Total Word Count: [Calculated Word Count]
Primary Twist: [The name of the twist you selected]

Chapter 1
Summary: [2-3 line summary of the chapter.]
Word Count: [e.g., 900]

Chapter 2
Summary: [2-3 line summary of the chapter.]
Word Count: [e.g., 950]

[Continue this format for all subsequent chapters until the story is complete.]

export const MULTIPLE_HOOKS_PROMPT_TEMPLATE = `I want you to act as a master storyteller, specializing in writing powerful, emotionally gripping opening scenes for YouTube videos. Your goal is to create 3 distinct, unforgettable hooks that grab the viewer's attention immediately, make them feel a deep emotional connection to the story's victim, and fill them with curiosity about the deeper mystery you will tease.

## TASK INSTRUCTIONS
Refer to the Video Title, Chapter 1 Summary, and the chosen Primary Twist / Story Deepener I provide. Write 3 distinct, powerful hooks of approximately 100-150 words each that follow the specific formula below for maximum impact.

## CONTEXT
- Video Title: {title}
- Chapter 1 Summary: {chapter1Summary}
- Primary Twist / Story Deepener: {twist}

## THE CURIOSITY FORMULA (Advanced)
Each hook must follow this four-part structure:
1.  **Start with the Hidden Horror:** Begin directly with the victim's tragic situation. Use the first sentence to show them trapped, scared, or in a terrible state. Do not waste any time on scenery.
2.  **Introduce the Innocent Fa√ßade:** Immediately contrast the hidden horror with a seemingly normal or innocent exterior. Show how this terrible secret was hidden in plain sight. This creates immediate mystery.
3.  **The Catalyst and the False Assumption:** Introduce the hero who discovers the secret through a small detail. Crucially, state that the hero (and the audience) initially believes the problem is simple or small (e.g., "They thought they were dealing with just one cruel man."). This sets up the twist.
4.  **The Shocking Reveal (Tailored to the Twist):** End the hook by shattering that initial assumption. This is the most important step. You must hint at the specific Primary Twist that the story will follow. Do not use a generic "it was worse than they thought." Be specific in your tease.

## LANGUAGE AND TONE REQUIREMENTS
-   **Use Extremely Simple English:** Write as if explaining the story to a 5th grader. The power comes from the emotion, not complex vocabulary.
-   **Short, Punchy Sentences:** Use short, direct sentences to build an urgent, easy-to-follow rhythm.
-   **Focus on Emotion:** Your primary goal is to make the viewer feel pity for the victim, shock at the secret, and an intense need to understand the deeper mystery you've introduced.

## EXAMPLES OF ADVANCED HOOKS (Tailored to the Twist)
-   Video Title: A Little Girl Heard Cries From a Dark Basement, Uncovering Dozens of Caged Dogs.
-   **Example 1: The "Bigger Crime" Twist:** "Dozens of dogs were trapped in small cages inside a dark, quiet basement. From the outside, the old house looked abandoned. No one knew about the terrible secret hidden beneath the floorboards. But a 10-year-old girl heard a sound no one else did, and when she told her lawyer father, they thought they were dealing with one cruel man. They had no idea they were about to uncover a secret so big, it would expose a criminal operation that shocked the entire town."
-   **Example 2: The "Personal Connection" Twist:** "Dozens of dogs were trapped in small cages inside a dark, quiet basement. From the outside, the old house looked abandoned. No one knew about the terrible secret hidden beneath the floorboards. But a 10-year-old girl heard a sound no one else did, and when she told her lawyer father, they thought they were dealing with a random act of cruelty. They had no idea this discovery was not an accident, and that the man responsible had a hidden, dark connection to their own family's past."
-   **Example 3: The "Custody Battle" Twist:** "Dozens of dogs were trapped in small cages inside a dark, quiet basement. From the outside, the old house looked abandoned. No one knew about the terrible secret hidden beneath the floorboards. But a 10-year-old girl heard a sound no one else did, and when she told her lawyer father, they thought the mission was to bring one man to justice. They believed that once the dogs were rescued, they were finally safe, but they were wrong. The battle to save them was only the beginning."

## FINAL OUTPUT FORMAT
Your output MUST be a valid JSON array of 3 strings. Do NOT wrap the JSON in markdown code blocks like \`\`\`json. Your entire response must be ONLY the raw JSON, starting with \`[\` and ending with \`]\`.

const MASTER_TITLE_FORMULA = `
## THE VIRAL TITLE FORMULA (MANDATORY)
You are an expert at creating viral YouTube titles for a specific storytelling niche. Your titles MUST follow a very strict, two-part formula. This is not a suggestion; it is a command.

### Part 1: The Emotional Hook
Start with a powerful, emotional hook. This can be:
- A direct, heart-wrenching quote from a victim (often a child). Use single or double quotes.
  - Examples: "Mom‚Ä¶ It Hurts‚Ä¶", "Nobody Wants Me Here‚Ä¶", "Daddy‚Ä¶ I Haven‚Äôt Eaten", "Please‚Ä¶ Don‚Äôt Send Me Back,"
- A vivid description of a tragic or mysterious situation.
  - Examples: "A Forgotten Mansion Nobody Wanted", "A Woman Left on the Tracks to Die", "140¬∞F Under the Hot Sun, 3 Little Golden Puppies Lie on the Road"

### Part 2: The Hero & The Twist
Immediately follow the hook with an em-dash (‚Äî) and then reveal the hero and the shocking twist or discovery.
- **The Heroes:** The heroes are typically a compassionate figure paired with a K9/dog (e.g., "A Soldier and His K9," "A Veteran and His Dog," "A Cop and His K9") or a single heroic figure ("A Doctor," "A Billionaire").
- **The Twist:** This part should create intense curiosity. Use phrases like: "Found What Nobody Dared to Imagine," "Discovered the Unthinkable," "Changed Everything," "Revealed a Hidden Truth," "Shattered Their Hearts."

### NON-NEGOTIABLE RULES
1.  **Strict Character Limit:** All titles MUST be under 100 characters.
2.  **Follow the Formula:** Hook ‚Äî Hero & Twist. Do not deviate.
3.  **Use High-Emotion Language:** Words like "Whispered," "Sobbed," "Begged," "Shattered," "Unthinkable" are key.

## EXAMPLES OF PERFECT TITLES (STUDY THESE CAREFULLY)
- "Mom‚Ä¶ It Hurts‚Ä¶ The Twins Sobbed ‚Äî Soldier and His K9 Found What Nobody Dared to Imagine"
- "Nobody Wants Me Here‚Ä¶The Little Girl Whispered ‚Äî Soldier and His K9 Discovered the Unthinkable"
- "Little Girl Whispered, ‚ÄòDaddy‚Ä¶ I Haven‚Äôt Eaten‚Äô ‚Äî What A Soldier and His K9 Found Changed Everything"
- "Little Girl Whispers, ‚ÄòSave My Baby!‚Äô ‚Äî What a Cop and His Dog Did Will Shock You"
- "Two Little Girls Whispered, ‚ÄòIt Hurts‚Ä¶ We‚Äôre Hungry‚Äô ‚Äî What the Doctor Found Changed Everything"
- "Before His Execution, He Asked for One Last Thing ‚Äî But the Dog Revealed a Hidden Truth‚Ä¶"
- "A Forgotten Mansion Nobody Wanted ‚Äî Until a Veteran and His Dog Uncovered a $200M Secret"
- "HOA Tried to Destroy a Blind Veteran‚Äôs Dog ‚Äî But the Truth Shocked the Entire Neighborhood"
- "A Woman Left on the Tracks to Die ‚Äî Until a Soldier and His K9 Delivered an Unexpected Ending"
- "Too Weak to Hold Her Babies, She Fell in the Snow ‚Äî Until a K9‚Äôs Rescue Changed Everything"
- "Please‚Ä¶ Don‚Äôt Send Me Back,‚Äô the Little Girl Begged ‚Äî But the K9 Stood Guard in the Scorching Heat"
- "A PTSD Soldier and His K9 Saw a Girl Raise Her Hand ‚Äî What They Found Shattered Their Hearts"
- "Twin Girl Whispered, ‚ÄúWe Were Bad‚Ä¶ So Mom Left Us Here‚Ä¶‚Äù ‚Äî But the K9 Wouldn‚Äôt Let That Be the End"
